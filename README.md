# Survey Form
Survey Form Project - freeCodeCamp

In this project I made a survey about software development in order to know how people learn it and what areas of software development they prefer.

Things I learnt:
- how to use different input element types like text, email, age, radio and checkbox
- how to use the required attribute and setting limits to an input like "age"

This page is built using plain HTML and CSS. 
In order to make the page responsive I have added Bootstrap in a later stage.
